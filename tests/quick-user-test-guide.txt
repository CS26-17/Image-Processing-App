10-Minute User Test Script

Goal
- Check whether a first-time user can complete the core workflow: upload, edit, undo/redo, save, and recover from errors.
- Identify usability friction points (wording, button discoverability, and feedback timing).

Participant
- 1 person who is not on the project team (preferably first-time user).
- Device: laptop with mouse/trackpad.

Setup
1. Launch the app.
2. Prepare 2 valid images (Image A, Image B) and 1 non-image file (for example, a .txt file).
3. Open notes and record observations using the template below.

Moderator Intro (30 seconds)
"Please use this like a new app you just installed. Think out loud while using it. We are testing the product, not you. Any confusion is useful feedback."

Tasks (about 8 minutes)

1. First Upload (1 min)
Task: Load Image A into the app.
Observe: Can they quickly find upload? Do they understand current status?
Pass: Upload completed and image displayed within 60 seconds.

2. Go to Modification and perform two edits (1.5 min)
Task: Rotate image 90 degrees and increase brightness slightly.
Observe: Do they understand preview vs apply? Is status feedback clear?
Pass: Both edits are completed and visible.

3. Undo/Redo (1 min)
Task: Undo once, then redo once.
Observe: Is behavior predictable? Can user tell current state?
Pass: Image state switches correctly both ways.

4. Filter toggle and removal (1.5 min)
Task: Apply a blur-like filter, then switch filter back to "None".
Observe: Do they understand "None" means remove filter?
Pass: Image returns to pre-filter state.

5. Error recovery (1 min)
Task: Open save flow and cancel; then drop/select a non-image file.
Observe: Are error messages understandable and actionable?
Pass: No crash; user can continue workflow.

6. Replace image and save (2 min)
Task: Load Image B, perform one edit, save it.
Observe: Do they realize they are editing the new image? Is save flow smooth?
Pass: Save succeeds and output matches expectation.

Observation Template
- Task 1: pass/fail, time, friction points
- Task 2: pass/fail, time, friction points
- Task 3: pass/fail, time, friction points
- Task 4: pass/fail, time, friction points
- Task 5: pass/fail, time, friction points
- Task 6: pass/fail, time, friction points
- Subjective scores (1-5):
  - Learnability
  - Confidence while operating
  - Error message clarity

Quick Acceptance Criteria
1. At least 5 of 6 tasks complete on first attempt.
2. No blocked confusion longer than 30 seconds.
3. User can recover and continue after error scenarios.
